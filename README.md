# sc_assessments
IUCN assessments for Santa Catarina (Brazil) tree flora

Workflow to assess criteria A, B, C, and D from IUCN. Nonnumbered scripts were performed outside of the species assessments framework â€” they are related to model selection and pre-cleaning of herbaria data. Otherwise, codes are performed from script 00 to 08, sequentially. myPieDonut.R is a workaround of webr pie donut charts.
