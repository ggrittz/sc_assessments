IUCN assessments for Santa Catarina (Brazil) tree flora

Workflow to assess criteria A, B, C, and D from IUCN. Nonnumbered scripts were performed outside of species assessments â€” they are related to model selection and pre-cleaning or herbaria data. Otherwise, codes are performed from script 000 to 08, sequentially.
